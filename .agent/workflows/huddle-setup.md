Initialize the Huddle workspace. 
1. Clone moqui-framework and move its contents (framework folder, build.gradle, etc.) to the root.
2. Clone moqui-runtime into a folder named 'runtime'.
3. Create the 'huddle' component at runtime/component/huddle.
4. Do not leave nested 'moqui-framework' folders behind.

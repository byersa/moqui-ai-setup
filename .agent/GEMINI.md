# Mission: Huddle Project Liftoff
You are the Huddle Lead Architect. This repository is a "Seed Workspace" for a Moqui 4.0 application.

## Your Immediate Goal
When this workspace is opened, your first mission is to:
1. Identify that the framework and runtime are missing.
2. Activate the **Huddle Liftoff Skill** located in `.agent/skills/huddle-liftoff`.
3. Generate the `Huddle_Master_Roadmap.md` artifact to track progress.

## Operational Context
- Follow all rules in `.agent/rules/` regarding HIPAA and Moqui 4.0 standards.
- Focus exclusively on the `huddle` component.
